The goal is to keep numbers very small for damage and health. I want you to come up with the formulas and also adjust the power and armor of all the items in the game so far as well as the base damage of all the abilities and the attack and armor of the current monsters that exist. Here is a list of requirements you can use as guidance. 

    Auto Attack Damage will be influenced be these 3 aspects - Power (only given by equipment), Skill Value (melee, archery, and magic depending on what item type the player has equipped), and the level of the player. Power will be the most important factor, then skill value, then player level. In the respective order, I am thinking 75%/15%/10% for the attack value.
    Abilities will work the same way but they will simply get added damage from their base damage value. skillId value will determine the skill value type to use.
    Creatures only have Damage and Attack properties. You will need to find a good way to calculate their damage formula. You'll need to find a good balance for the player damage reduction which I will cover more in the next point.
    Damage reduction will be influenced by these 3 aspects - Armor (only given by equipment), Shield skill value (important, this is only considered if the player has a shield in their offhand equipped), and level. Armor is the most important, then shield value, and their level. I am thinking this for their weights respectively: 75%/15%/10%.
    Also relating to point 1 2 and 3, you will need to figure out damage reduction for monsters that is solely based on their armor.
    All of the items and creatures in the game right now are going to be the weakest items and creatures so you can change any of the health, attack, power, armor, and defense values to find a good balance. Remember, this should be close to the balance of how slow older versions of Tibia game were. We want to keep numbers very small in this game.
